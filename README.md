# Orbit

Sydney renter suburb-matching that starts with *who you are*, not what you can afford.

Most rent tools ask you to pick a suburb and sort by price. Orbit inverts that: answer a 7-question personality quiz, and the whole Sydney metro colours from red (poor fit) through grey (neutral) to green (your kind of place). Budget is a soft gate, not a filter — aspirational suburbs stay visible, they just rank lower.

## The six dimensions

Every Sydney suburb and every quiz-taker gets scored on the same axes:

- **social_energy** — nightlife, bar density, late-night venues
- **aesthetic** — indie cafés, galleries, vintage, chain-to-indie ratio
- **pace** — walkability, density, 24/7 venues vs residential calm
- **outdoor** — beaches, parks, surf, bushwalks, sports clubs
- **culinary** — cuisine diversity (Shannon entropy), restaurant density
- **community** — schools, libraries, community venues, low churn

The vectors are mean-centred at 50 before cosine — dimensions you don't care about don't spuriously inflate matches, so a "chill beach + food" persona doesn't get Kings Cross because Kings Cross is spiky on things they're neutral on.

## User flow

1. Quiz overlay fetches `GET /quiz` and asks 7 lifestyle questions with large tappable cards, ending on a weekly rent slider.
2. `POST /match` returns two parallel lists: the top-ranked **45 curated suburbs** (with full detail, explanations, mock Domain listings) and a **473-suburb heatmap payload** (all of Sydney, compact, budget-free).
3. A Leaflet `L.GridLayer` renders a per-pixel gaussian-interpolated heatmap across the metro — a 9-stop red→grey→green gradient keyed to personality fit, not price.
4. Clicking any suburb opens a right-side drawer with all six dimension bars, template explanations pulled from real POI counts, an LLM-written persona paragraph, three mock Domain listings, and a **"Real places nearby"** card with venues from the Foursquare OS Places dataset (Hugging Face).
5. A toggle flips the heatmap to commute time from the CBD — same UI, different lens.

## Architecture

                ▼
        data/features/suburbs.parquet   (only file the request path reads)
```

The feature parquet is rebuilt offline by a pipeline that runs once, not per request:

```
OSM (Overpass)  →  fetch_osm_pois.py  →  osm_pois_sydney.parquet
                                             │
                                             ▼
                                      osm_to_fsq.py
                                             │
                                             ▼
                                      fsq_sydney.parquet
                                             │
                                             ▼
                                        build.py
                                             │
                                             ▼
                              features/suburbs.parquet
```

Matching is deterministic: preference-aware cosine similarity, smooth-logistic budget gate (0.3–1.0 multiplier), template explanations grounded in per-suburb breakdown counts so the copy never hallucinates a beach in Chippendale. LLM copy from `llm.py` sees the same strict evidence blob and is instructed to cite only what's in it.

## Tech stack

Vanilla JavaScript + Leaflet on the frontend. FastAPI + Polars + pandas on the backend. Parquet for the feature store. OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for persona and per-suburb copy (optional — falls back to templates). Deployed on Railway via Nixpacks; `index.html` is served as a static file by FastAPI's `StaticFiles` mount so the frontend and API share an origin.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cameronli8/orbit.git
cd orbit
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt --break-system-packages
cd backend
uvicorn api:app --reload --port 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/` — the FastAPI app serves `index.html` from the repo root, so the frontend and API are same-origin and no CORS or proxy config is needed.

### Optional environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in whichever of these you want:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — unlocks the LLM-written persona and suburb copy. Without it the frontend shows the deterministic template strings.
- `DOMAIN_CLIENT_ID` / `DOMAIN_CLIENT_SECRET` — swaps the mock rental listings for live Sydney 2BR Domain listings (cached for 24 h).
- `HF_TOKEN` — required only if you want to regenerate `data/hf_samples.json` from scratch. Needs access to the gated `foursquare/fsq-os-places` dataset on Hugging Face.

`GET /health` reports which data layers are live (`llm`, `listings_source`).

## Data sources

Orbit is honest about where its data comes from:

- **Foursquare Open Source Places** (via Hugging Face, `foursquare/fsq-os-places`) — the dataset provided for the hackathon. Orbit uses it directly for the drawer's "Real places nearby" card, sampled at the 45 rated suburbs and committed as `data/hf_samples.json`. The one-shot fetcher is `backend/fetch_hf_samples.py`.
- **OpenStreetMap** (via the Overpass API) — the scoring pipeline's actual POI source. OSM gives every-suburb coverage without HF auth, and `osm_to_fsq.py` reshapes its output into the Foursquare schema `build.py` expects. Used because the full FSQ slice is gated and Railway's free tier can't host hundreds of gigabytes.
- **ABS SAL suburb polygons** — pulled once by `fetch_suburb_polygons.py` into `data/suburbs.geojson` for the frontend's hover/click targets and suburb boundary rendering.
- **NSW Fair Trading Rent and Sales Report** (December 2025 quarter) — postcode-level 2BR medians hand-curated into `suburbs_ref.py`.
- **Domain Listings API** — live 2BR listings when credentials are configured; otherwise mock listings deep-linking to the matching realestate.com.au filter.

## API surface

- `GET /health` — `{status, n_suburbs, n_questions, llm, listings_source}`
- `GET /quiz` — 7 questions, scoring weights stripped
- `POST /match` — body `{answers, budget, limit}`, returns `{user_vector, suburbs, heatmap}`
- `POST /profile` — body `{answers}`, returns `{headline, summary, wants, source, user_vector}`
- `GET /suburb/{name}?<user_vector query params>&persona=…` — full drawer payload including AI block
- `GET /pois` — compact OSM POI list for the map layer

## Sanity checks the backend passes

Kings Cross, Potts Point, and Darlinghurst top social energy. Enmore, Erskineville, Petersham, and Dulwich Hill top aesthetic. Coogee, Bronte, Manly, and Bondi top outdoor. Cabramatta tops culinary on Vietnamese-Chinese density plus cuisine entropy. Mosman, Lane Cove, and Neutral Bay top community. A hardcore beach persona ranks Bondi first and Manly second; a balanced "beach but also values food and community" persona correctly prefers Tempe over spiky pure-beach suburbs, which is the behaviour that justifies the mean-centring trick.

## AI acknowledgement

Orbit was built with substantial help from AI coding assistants — primarily Anthropic's Claude (via Claude Code and Cursor) — across the stack: the preference-weighted matcher, FastAPI cross-worker telemetry and admin kill-switch, the Leaflet per-pixel heatmap shader, the drawer UX, and large portions of the data pipeline. Product direction, the six-dimension scoring design, mean-centring and the preference-weighted reformulation, the choice of Shannon entropy and indie-to-chain ratio as derived features, and all final decisions were the author's.

Runtime AI usage is narrow and gated. OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini writes the optional persona paragraph (`POST /profile`) and per-suburb copy (`GET /suburb/{name}`) when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set and the live admin kill-switch is enabled. Every number surfaced in the UI — the six dimension bars, the "9 parks / 43% indie / 2 beaches"-style explanations, the match scores — comes from the deterministic matcher in `matcher.py`; the LLM only paraphrases an evidence blob it is handed and the frontend falls back to template strings whenever the LLM path is disabled, unavailable, or errors out. No user-facing claim originates from the model.
